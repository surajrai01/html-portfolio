    <h3>Om-Dar-B-Dar</h3>
    <p>
        The whole film is like a journey through dreams. Excellent cinematography and the credit goes to the indigenous treatment<br />
         which is rare & innovative. The background score has been used differently, sometimes it's chaos but it brings a <br />
         hallucinatory effect, however dramatic and pleasant. In true sense its a cult film.<br />
